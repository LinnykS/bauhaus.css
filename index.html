                        The first ECM release was Free at Last in 1969 by American pianist Mal Waldron. For some years 
                        the label specialised in jazz, releasing recordings by pianists Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, 
                        Paul Bley, Egberto Gismonti and Art Lande; saxophonist <a href="#/">Jan Garbarek</a>, vibraphonist Gary Burton;
                        drummers Jon Christensen and Paul Motian; guitarists Pat Metheny, <a href="#/">John
                        Abercrombie</a>, Ralph Towner, 
                        Bill Connors and Terje Rypdal; bassists Eberhard Weber, Arild Andersen, Charlie Haden, Barre 
                        Phillips and <a href="#/">Dave Holland</a>; and the Art Ensemble of Chicago.

                        <b>Jan Garbarek</b> is a Norwegian tenor and soprano saxophonist, active in the

                        There is a clear link between some ECM recordings and world music, especially the folk recordings
                        by Jan Garbarek and the work of Steve Tibbetts and Stephan Micus. Other examples of ECM's world
                        music are records by Codona, Tunisian oud musician Anouar Brahem, Indian violinist L. Shankar,
                        Jon Hassell, Dave Liebman and Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos.

                                The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars stating "Bjørnstad has
                                always valued subtlety and suggestion over frenetic engagement on his recordings.
                                That is certainly true here, but he is also a wise bandleader: he chose these
                                players for their myriad abilities to dialogue kinetically, listen deeply, and
                                respond powerfully whenever the music dictated, and he was correct in doing so across
                                the board. La Notte is rich, deep, and wonderful".

                                The All About Jazz review by John Kelman said that "Defined by stark simplicity and a
                                quiet majesty powered more by calm than energy, both Bjørnstad and Henryson value the
                                purity of every note, and the resultant overtones when permitted decay to their
                                inevitable conclusion.

                                The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars stating "The music is
                                generally mournful, full of space, floating and very much a soundtrack for one's
                                thoughts... Some listeners may enjoy its introspective and peaceful nature of
                                these performances but most will find this a bit of a bore.
