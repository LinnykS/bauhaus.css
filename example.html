                        We were saddened to learn that filmmaker Prashant Bhargava has died, aged just 42.
                        <a href="#/">Born and raised</a> on the South Side of Chicago, Prashant began his creative career as a
                        graffiti artist, and studied computer science at Cornell University and theatrical
                        directing at the Barrow Group and the Actors Studio.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        His directorial debut, Patang
                        (The Kite), premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and his work was widely acclaimed,
                        with film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praising him as “a poet of cinema.”
                        Prashant’s last film was Radhe Radhe, a multi-media collaboration with Vijay Iyer, which
                        celebrated the festival of Holi in Mathura, India, and also made allusions to Stravinsky’s
                        Rite of Spring. Radhe Radhe was issued on DVD and Blu-ray by ECM in 2014.
